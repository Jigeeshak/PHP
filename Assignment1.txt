Question:
How to access a php file from other location than the default location (htdocs folder from xmpp)

Answer:
1.  Make sure the below line is uncommented in file C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf
        Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

2. Place below code in the file C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

<VirtualHost localhost:80>
	ServerAdmin localhost
	ServerName localhost

	 DocumentRoot "D:/PHP"
	<Directory "D:/PHP">
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
        AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


This will direct the localhost to the above path

Revised Question:
change server name to something apart from localhost (maybe you can use "local.php.com")
From browser it must be accessible using "local.php.com"(locahost" and "local.php.com"  should work at same time )
